# Profiles

OpenTSR profiles define operational expectations above baseline schema validity.

- Core profile: fast adoption with strict schema conformance.
- High-Assurance profile: production signatures and stronger attribution.
- Edge Telemetry profile: constrained emitters with downstream enrichment.

Authoritative profile definitions are in [`spec/PROFILES.md`](https://github.com/KevinOBytes/OpenTSR/blob/main/spec/PROFILES.md).
